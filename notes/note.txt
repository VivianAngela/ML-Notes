Step by step 
- Check NaN count
- Check Unique value

- Check if features is normally distributed:
	- create histogram from data => is similar to normal distribution?
	- check skewness and kurtosis => near 1

- Detect Outlier
	- Create Boxplot to indicate outlier
	- Z-Score > 2.5 or 3 or 3.5

- Feature Selection
	- Filter by correlation
	  use features corr > 0.5
	  discard if features correlate each other
	- Wrapper Method
		- Backward Elimination
		  remove the worst performing features
		  with sm.OLS pvalues
		- Recursive Feature Elimination
		  rank feature according to importance with recursively removing non relevant feature
		  with RFE model
	- Embed Method
	  penalize its coefficient if the feature is irrelevant
	  Lasso Regularization
